# ReLaXed examples

This repository contains various examples of PDF documents written with [ReLaXed](https://github.com/RelaxedJS). It demonstrates how the Pug and SCSS languages can be advantageously used to create a wide variety of reusable document layouts while keeping a clarity of the source close to Markdown.

## Get started

First [install ReLaXed](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed#installing-relaxed), then clone or download this repository and start a session from the terminal by pointing ReLaXed to the master document of a project:

```
relaxed examples/report/report.pug
```

Now every time a file changes in the ``report/`` folder, a PDF document ``report.pdf`` will be generated.
