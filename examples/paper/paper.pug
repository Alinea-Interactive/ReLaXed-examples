    If we should claim at any time the right of criticism, we do it now, when the blunders and misfortunes which effected the failures of the last expeditions are deeply impressed on public minds, and nearly extinguish the little interest which is left for scientific work in the Arctic. We consider it in the spirit of progress of science, to prove the fallacy of a plan founded on theories like those of Mr. Melville, which cannot be accepted by scientific men, and must lead to disaster, or will at least be unsuccessful.<br />

    Through the issue of the New-York Evening post, Feb. 6, I opposed Mr. Melville’s plan of reaching the north pole <sup>1</sup> , as I could not consider the theory on which it is founded is correct. In answer to my remarks, Mr. Melville in the same paper, Feb. 17, maintains his position, and denounces his critics for hindering his endeavors, instead of *"sending him to prove his theories he has so much faith in, and permitting him to bring back the necessary facts that alone can carry conviction to the unbeliever without a theory."*   When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are

    $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

    He says, *"It would be more in the spirit of progress and the advancement of science, if my critics would propound new theories or other plans of progress, rather than simply find fault of say ‘I don’t believe.’”* We cannot coincide with this opinion of Mr. Melville, and claim the full right to criticise a plan of exploration before it is set in motion. What is the cause of so many failures of arctic expeditions and other undertakings? Is it the careless neglect of thorough deliberation before entering into expeditions, or is it the hostility of nature? Have we nothing to learn by the Jeannette and the Proteus?

    If we should claim at any time the right of criticism, we do it now, when the blunders and misfortunes which effected the failures of the last expeditions are deeply impressed on public minds, and nearly extinguish the little interest which is left for scientific work in the Arctic. We consider it in the spirit of progress of science, to prove the fallacy of a plan founded on theories like those of Mr. Melville, which cannot be accepted by scientific men, and must lead to disaster, or will at least be unsuccessful.
