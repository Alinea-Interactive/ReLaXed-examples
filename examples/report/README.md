# PDF Report with ReLaXed

This directory contains a sample report created with ReLaXed. While web-based resumes are increasingly popular, some employers still require a PDF document. PDF CVs can be created from Word or LaTeX templates, HTML/CSS layouts are more diverse and sometimes better looking.

Some highlights:

- We are using Semantic UI, a CSS framework providing many useful widgets to create modern-looking reports.
- We are including a few diagrams generated by ReLaXed with graphic web frameworks: a flowchart rendered by [Mermaid.js](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) and an histogram made with [Vegalite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). When the source-files ``diagram.mermaid`` or ``plot.vegalite.json`` files are modified, it triggers the re-rendering of the SVG plots ``diagram.svg`` and ``plot.svg``. The modification of these diagrams triggers in turn the re-rendering of the full document.
- If you want to write PDF reports using Semantic UI from Python, have a look at this [other project](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/pdf_reports).
